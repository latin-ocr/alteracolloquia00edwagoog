F. sumnum moon.

The chief uses of the subjunctive are :—

(1) Jussive subjunctive, i.e. in (a) commands, (b) wishes,
(c) prohibition-3:

(a) fiat sortitio. 4, 5.
sint pares sphaerae. 6, 23.
definiant arbitri. 7, 27.

(b) adsit Fortuna. 6, 21.
bene vertat. ’7, 19.
floreat Germania. 8, 9.

(ο) ne ante tempus riseris. 7, 21.

The Jussive subjunctive is sometimes used of events no ,
longer possible, the tense being imperfect or plupersect.

utinam huc deflexisses. 36, 3.

When used in questions, the Jussive subjunctive is some·
times called ‘ Deliberative. ’

qua fronte id faceret? 18, 3.

(2) Potentius subjunctive, used of events which miqht huppen
or miyht have happened, sometimes called ‘ Sub-
junctive of imagination.’

vix credas. 21, 20.

malim et onus et periculum. 11, 24.
minus discernas ovum ab ovo: 7, 6.
fortasse redderet. 22, 6.

istos statuerem in prima acie. 11, 3.
plus scio quam vellem. 14, 13.
dixisses ferocem esse. 15, 8.

The Subjunctive of conditional statement belongs here.
[Some think that in the examples just quoted there is a
suppressed condition: e.g. dixisses might mean ‘you would
have said, if you had been there.’]
