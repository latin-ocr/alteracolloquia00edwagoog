PREFAOE.

HE favourable reception which has been

accorded to Colloqw‘a Latina, published last
year, leads me to think that a second series of
dialogues may be found useful. As before, 1 have
allowed myself great freedom in the revision and
abbreviation of the text, in order to adapt these
‘little pictures ' for school use. 1 am more and
more impressed with Erasmus's wonderful com-
mand of the best Latin idiom and vocabulary.
He is equally admirable in sparkling dialogue‚ in
graphio description, and in reflective passages
often of great beauty. With him Latin is indeed
a living language 3 and he seems to invest all his
themes with the charin of a perennia] youthful-

neSS.
