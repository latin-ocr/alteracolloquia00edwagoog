11. lacus ranas-um, ‘a pond-full of frogs,’--genitive of
material; cf. tota plaustra spei (11, 13). It was customary for
the friends of the New Learning to speak violently of Duns
Scotus. Tyndale (writing in 1530) says 2—-‘ Remember ye not
how the old barking curs, Dunce's disciples, the children of
darkness, raged in every pulpit against Greek, Latin,' and
Hebrew.' And in 1535 one of Thomas Cromwell's Commis-
sioners at Oxford writes :—‘ We have utterly banished Dunce
from Oxford for ever. At New Gollege we found all the great
Quadrant Court full of the leaves of Dunce, the wind blowing
them into every corner.’ champions of the Old Learning
would constantly appeal to the authority of its famous doctor.
Those of the New Learning would reply, ‘ Oh, you are a Duns·
man,’ or, more briefly, ‘You are a Dunce.’ Thus from the
great conflict between the Old and New Learning we inherit
the words ‘ dunce ’ and ⁴ duncery.’ It has been remarked that
the fate of Duns was a hard one. The ‘subtle doctor,' the
‘wittiest of the School divines ' could not have deserved that
his name should have been turned into a by·word for invincible
stupidity (Trench). Α

17. spectaculorum perspicaces. See B. 4.

19. commodum, ‘just at the right time,'—an adverbial
accusative. Similarly the adverbs tum, primum, and others
are really accusatives. Plautus has commodum adveni domum.
Such accusatives would fall under A. 7.

21. intende, ‘strain your eyes,' ‘look hard!

24. tantundem, ‘Just a little bit.'

27. oculos tuos obsedit scotus, with a play on the Greek
word for ‘'darkness (skotos); cf. the passage of Tyndale
quoted above.

28. non est quod crucieris, ‘there is no reason for
torturing yourself? ,

29. tali praemio, ‘with such a recompense,’ attendant
circumstances3 see D. 2(1ι).

30. Actaeon vidit Dianam, According to the Greek legend,
Actaeon was a famous huntsman, who saw the Huntress Queen
bathing with her nymphs. Thereupon the goddess changed
him into a stag; and in this shape he was torn in pieces by
his own hounds.
