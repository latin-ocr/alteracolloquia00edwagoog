This is a char-ming idyll, written in 1514. The nine Muses
and three Graces are represented as visiting the earth to be
present at the marriage of Erasmus's friend Petrus Aegidius
(i.e. Peter Giles) to Cornelia. Writing to Sir Thomas More,
from Antwerp in 1517, Erasmus says z-—‘ Peter Giles and I are
being painted in one picture, which we intend to send you as
a present before long. He and his wife Cornelia send their
kindest regards to you and your wife.’ This picture was
painted by Quentin Matsys. Strange to say, it has been eut
in two; the Peter Giles is now in the collection of Lord Badnor
at Longior-d Castle, and the Erasmus is at St Petersburg.
Giles was very devoted to Erasmus3 he had already begun to
eolleot- his letters, and published a collection of them as early
as 1517.
