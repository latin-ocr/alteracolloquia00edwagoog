IV.

These two dialogues on Impressions os France introduce us
to several of Erasmus's favourite topice, viz. the evils of war,
the unruly ambitione of princes, and the hunt for snug
ecclesiastical appointmentS. The remarks about the pronun-
ciation of Latin are interesting.

19. ime benis fervent omnia. The first war of Francis I
with the Emperor charles V began in 1521 and did not end
till 1526. Charles claimed Milan and the Duchy of Burgundy.
Francis claimed Navarre and NapleS. The French, under
Lautrec‚ were driven from Milan (1522), and charles of Bourbon
transferred his allegiance to Charles V. For the rest of the
French missortunes see below (10, 17).

entirely changed'; see O. 1 (a).

6. vestis non facit Gallum. He is thinking of the proverb,
‘ The cowl does not make the monk.’

‚ 7. calles Gallice. Understand loqui.

10. magistris haudquaquam mutis, ‘with some great
chatterboxes to teach me’; see D. 2(e).

13. Latinum sono Gallice. The French pronounced Latin
words as if they were French, neglecting the original quan-
tities. In 1528 Erasmus published a dialogue on the pronun-
ciation os Latin and Greek. He preferred the English
pronunciation of Latin to the French,

14. nunquam scribes bona carmina, i.e. Latin verses.
He would make many false quantities.

16. periit tibi, i.e. ‘you have lost’; cf. nobis redisti
(above). ’

23. erat, nisi secus esset visum superis. For this vivid
conditional sentence see F. 2. The meaning is, ‘There was
(enough trouble) 3 but the gods above thought otherwise.’
