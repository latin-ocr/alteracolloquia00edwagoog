11. lovaniensium Academiam. Louvain is fifteen miles
east of Brussels. Αι the end of the fifteenth century its
University was perhaps the most famous place of edueation in
Europe. Its competitive honours system—aooording ιο one
opinion (probably incorreot) the model of the Cambridge
Tripos—‘oontributed largely ιο raise Louvain ιο the high
position which it attained before other universities were aroused
from their fifteenth century torpor by the Revival of learning ’
(Bashdall). Erasmus in 1521 says that Louvain yields ιο
Paris alone in its numbers—about 3000 students3 and more
flook there every day.

12. bona. verba, ‘speak words of good omen?

14. ιοι porc1 grunniunt. The ‘grunting hogs’ are the

Porci. In 1517 we find him staying at Louvain with the
Orator of the University. Shortly afterwards he tried ιο settle
there for about ,three year-33 but he oould not make himself
happy. ‘ Here there is snarling in abundanoe,' he writes; and
again, ‘ Some Frisrs are beginning ιο inoite the mob ιο stone-
throwing! ’

21. amoenum exstruet templum. This ‘ lovely temple ’ of
the Muses is the Collegium Trilinque, the Oollege of the Three
Languages, i.e. for the study of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew.
Money for its foundation, in fact his whole estate, had been
left in his will by Jerome Buslidius‚ the friend of Erasmus and
Peter Giles. He was very ill at this time3 and, in view of his
approaehing end, the Muses are able ιο prophesy the building

of the new College.
22. versabimur Lovanii, ⁴ we will make Louvain our
