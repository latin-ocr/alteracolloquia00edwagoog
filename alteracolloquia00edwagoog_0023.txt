Introduction xvii

of the twenty-two years which remained to him were Ἴ
spent in that city. First 116 stayed a few months
there, gathering round him a circle of eager students,
including the celebrated printer‚ J ohann Froben.
Then he tried to live at Louvain‚ where he had a
house of his own. But he was thoroughly disgusted
with the bigotry of the Flemish clergy and the state
of the University there, which was at the mercy of
monks united in intolerant opposition to the New
Learning. During this period of his life Erasmus
was often in difficulties. He received many offers of
pensions and posts ecclesiastical and academica13 but
he declined them all. Rex essem, εἰ iuvenis essem, he
says sadly. In 1521 he settled permanently at Basel
as general editor and adviser to Froben's Press For
seven years, i.e. till Froben's death, he ground
incessantly in this ‘ mill,’ as he styles it.

It was at Basel in the year 1516 that Erasmus
published the first Greek text of the N ew Testament.
This contributed much more to the liberation of the
human mind than all the controversial turmoil of
Luther. Certainly it was 11011 a work of critical skill.
The Greek was printed from a single Basel manuscript,
which was sent as ‘ copy ’ to Froben's Press, cor-
rections being introduced in a haphazard way from
perhaps five other manuscripts Moreover‚ the
printing, which was unduly hurried on, was com-
pleted in a few monthS. Only one of the manuscripts
contained the book of Revelation3 and in this the
last six verses of the last chapter were missing.
Strange to say, these verses appear in Erasmus's
Greek, translated by him from the Latin Vulgate.
