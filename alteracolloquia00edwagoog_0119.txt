dic Marce Tulli. Old English writers often call him ‘ Tully.'

10. senex scripsit de senectute. The Cato maior or de
senectute was written in 44 Β.ο. In the following year Cicero

‘prisons‚' each constructed to hold a chariot and horses. At
one time there were as many as twelve of these. Their front
doors opened on to the arena ; and at a given signal these were

thrown open simultaneously. Compare the ‘starting·gate’ of
the modern racc-course.
