Notes 59

24. annonae—oportet, ‘ corn must have been dear where
you were.'

26. sceleratorum militum. Erasmus had a great horror
of the vagabond mercenary soldiers. They were the curse of
the time. See Dialogue X, The soldier and the Carthusian.

28. ut bellum suscipiant cum aquila, i.e. the Imperial
Eagle of Oharles V.

30. exemplum scarabaei. He is alluding to the Latin
proverb, ⁴ The beetle pursues the eagle,’ which is founded on
the fable in which the beetle avenges itself for an insult by
destroying the eagle’s egge. Erasmus in his Adayia (where
many old proverbe are made texts for little essays on current
affairs) bases hereon a satire on the misdeeds of great monarche,
who are typified by the eagle.

1. nemo—nen. For the idiom cf. nusquam non ‘reynat
(4, 4). '

16. mali, partitive genitive; see B. 6.

17. Galli—nen dicendis malis affliguntur. About the time
of the first complete edition of the Colloquies (1523) occurred
the disastrous invasion of Italy by the French under Bonnivet.
'I'he chevalier Bayard fell during the retreat. 'l'hen the
imperial forces invaded southern France. Worse missortunes
were to follow. In 1525 Francis Ι was defeated and captured
at Pavia‚ and in the following year he assented to the

humiliating Peace of Madrid.
· 19. 6 cupiditate principum. So elsewhere Erasmus
writes in bitter satire :—‘ Kings who are scarcely human are
called divine3 serene though they turn the world upside down
in a tempest of war ; illustrious though they grovel in ignorance
of all that is noble.'

23. suaque causa mundum—conditum. Of. his celebrated
words ⁴ It is the people who build citieS, but the madness of
princes destroys them.' It is strange to think that now for the
first time in modern history a new spirit began to call in
question what had hitherto seemed the elementary principles
of political order.
