Α Part of the 24th chapter of charles Reade’s The Gloister
and the Hearth ie based on this dialogue. This is how the
novelist describes Gerard’s arrival at a German inn, following
Erasmus very closely :—‘ At present it looked more like a
mausoleum than a hotel. Nothing moved nor sounded either
in it or about it. Gerard hammered on the great oek
door: no answer. He hallooed: no reply. After a while he
hallooed louder, and at last a little round window opened; a
man's head protruded cautiously‚ like a tortoiee'e from its shell,
and eyed Gerard stolidly‚ but never uttered a syllable....‘ How
am I to get within, an’t please you? ' At this the head popped
in, as if the laet question had shot it ς and a hand popped
out, pointed round the corner of the building, and elammed
the windOW.’
