'70 Notes

21. novem—Musae cum tribus Gratiis. 'l'he nine Muses
were, according to the early Greek view, the inspiring goddesses
of song; in later times they were regarded as the patronesses of
different kinds of literature and of the liberal arts, each Muse
having a separate function,—-e.g. Calliope the Muse of epic
poetry, Clio the Muse of history, Urania the Muse of astronomy.
They are represented as attending this wedding because of the
great refinement of the bride and bridegroom. The Graces
are three goddesses who enhance the pleasures of life by refine·
ment and gentleness. To one form os loveliness—poetry—
they are specially devoted, and on this account they are
represented as the friends of the Muses.

22. cultiores aut magis alacres, ‘more beautifully arrayed
or with more eager looks.'

2. quam-sibi haerent, ‘ how sweetly they embrace one
another‚'—the ordinary attitude of the Graces in ancient art.

7. hic, ‘on this occasion,’ ‘to see this vision.'

8. fonte Musarum. On mount Helicon in Boeotia, where
the Muses loved to dwell, were their sacred lountains called
Aganippe and Hippocrene.

10. ego hausi e fonte scoti. John Duns the Boot, com·
monly called ‘Duns Scotus,’ was probably born at Duns in
Berwickshire. Others derive his name from Dunston in
Northumberland. He was a great teacher of the Francisean
Order‚ one of the most famous of the medieval theologians
called Schoolmen, trained in the eloister and cathedral schools‚
which charlemagne and his successore had founded. At the
Revival of learning it was thought a mark of intellectual
progress to have thrown off their yoke. Duns died in 1308.
On his tombstone at Cologne is this epitaph :—

Scotia me qenait
Anqlia me suscepit
Gallia me docuit
Colonia me tenet.
