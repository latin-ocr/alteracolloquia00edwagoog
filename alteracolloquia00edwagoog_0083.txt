Notes 53

ΙΙ.

Four boys play tennis of a primitive type, not lawn·tennis,
which is, of course, a very modern institution. These
players would have no rackets. 'l'he old French name for
tennis, jeu de paume, shows that the ball was originally struck
by the hand. Next a glove was worn. And then upon the
glove strings and oross-strings were stretched to give the ball
a greater impetus. Hence the racket was evolved. It is said
that in the time of Henry VH the hand was sometimes matched
against the racket even in the royal tennis-court at Windsor.
The gamo was very popular among the Freneh in the middle
ages. 'l'hey took it from the ItalianS. The mention of the
game in the following spirited passage from Henry V (Act 1,
Scene 2) is interesting. It shows us that the technicalities of
tennis must have been generally understood in Shakespeare's
time.

Kinq Henry. What treasure, uncle ‘?

Emeter. Tennis-balls‚ my liege.

Henry. We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.

His present and your p'ains we thank you for.

When we have mateh'd our rackets to these balls,
We will in France‚ by God’s grace, play a set

shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard.

Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
That all the courts of France will be disturbed

With chaces.
