xviii Introduction

In spite of defects, which might naturally be expected
in the first work of its kind, this 'book had great
value as being the means by which the Greek text

in which he proclaims his desire for an open Bible‚

Saracens and Turks. ‘I long for the time,' he

himself while he follows the plough, when the weaver
shall hum them to the tune of the shuttle, when the
traveller shall beguile with them the weariness of
the Journey! Another important work of Erasmus
was his Parapamis, a series of Latin paraphrases
of all the books of the New Testament except
Revelation,——his aim being to bring home the spirit
and subject of each book to the mind of the ordinary
reader. They were translated into English 3 and soon
there was a copy in every parish church in the
country. Finally‚ in his editions of the Greek and

among Christian scholam, were published in the year
1516, dedicated to his old benefactor, Archbishop
