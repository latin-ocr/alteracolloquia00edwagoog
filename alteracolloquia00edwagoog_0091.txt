Notes 61
V.

Eusebius (Mr Godliman) invites Timothy and three other
young friends to early dinner at his suburbsn cottage. Each
of the four is to introduce an umbra or ‘shadow,’ i.e. a guest of
his own, not directly invited by the host. It is to be noticed
that the prandium (at 10 o'clock) is regarded ss the first mesl
of the day3 for the informal breakfast (biber-ia or ‘drink‚’
English bever) was only gradually coming into vogue. see
Introduction to Dialogue XII.

20. Socrates philosophus. It hes been remarked that
Socrates was not so much a philosopher as a great cross-
examining missionary, striving to convince all men that they
had the conceit of knowledge without the reality.

urbes praeferebat agris. ‘ The philosophy of Socrates was
in every sense the philosophy oi the market-place. Very
rarely he might be found under the shade of the plane-trec or
the caverned rocks of the Ilissus, enjoying the grassy slope of
its banks and the white and purple flowers oi its agnus castus
shrubs. But ordinarily, whether in the city, in the dusty road
between the Long Walls, or in the busy mart of Peirseus, his
place was amongst men.... Gradually the crowd gathered
round him. At first he spoke of the tanners and the smiths
end the drovers, who were plying their trades about him; and
they shouted with laughter as he poured forth his homely
jokes. But soon the magic charm of his voice made itself felt.
The laughter ceased; the crowd thickened; the gay youth,
whom nothing else could tame, stood awestruck in his presence ’

(Dean Stanley).
21. esset. The subjunctive is due to virtual oratio
