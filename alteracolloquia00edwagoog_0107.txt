Two brothers meet after a two years’ separation. One has
ser-ved as a soldier of fortune, i.e. a member of one oi the
mercenary bands led by Gondottieri or leaders of hired troops.
Unconnected with the people ior whom they fought and always
ready to change sides for higher pay, they were a terrible
scourge to Europe. The seamy side of military life is well
displayed by contrast with the character of the other brother,

. a monk of the best type, devoted to the life of a small Priory.

He is a member of the Carthusian order, which took its name
from the famous monastery la Grande Chai-treme near Grenoble.

„This order had many houses in England‚ of which the Charm-
house in London was the most important.

6. piscium perpetuum esum. Erasmus must be thinking
feelingly of his own monastic life. He himself could not
bear the smell or taste of fish. ‘ My heart,’ he said, ‘is
Catholic, my stomach Lutheran.’ Also he tells us that his
own health was delicate, especially in Lent, because he
abhorred fish.

9. suilla, carne understood.
