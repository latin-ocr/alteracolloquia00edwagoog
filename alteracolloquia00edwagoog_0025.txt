Introduction - xix

edition of the Familiaa· Colloquies. Erasmus's
main idea about Latin school-books was that they
should introduce the pupil as soon as possible to
Latin reading, without keeping him long over the
drudgery of . grammar 3 also that these books should
have a moral purpose. Accordingly, the object of
the colloquias, as stated by Erasmus, is to 61113166 13116
young (1) ad elcqantiam Latini sermonis and (2) ad
pietatem3 also (3) in particular, to caution them
against ‘ 13116 misdirected ambitions and outrageous
superstitious of the vulgar ² 3 for ‘it is better that
they should learn this from a book than from
Experience, the mistress of fools.' First, there is the
purely educational object of teaching good Latin as 6
living colloquial language, without much attention to
the learning of grammar by rote 3 for, as 116 says,
multis amorra sumt qrammatices praecepta. Secondly,
116 1168 6 moral and religious aim3 011 131118 116 writes
beautifully in the dedication 130 13116 Colloquies,
addressed to his godson, J ohann Erasmius Froben, son
of his printer friend, only six years old, but showing
wonderful promise. Thirdly, 116 desires to combat
popular ignorance and superstition, the prevalence
of which distressed him so acutely. These three
objects will be ,found abundantly illustrated in the
selection of dialogues given in this edition. Some of
the slighter pieces are evidently written with the
view of teaching the elements of Latin only, and
have no other interest. This class of dialogue is
necessarily over-represented in this edition, which
contains only a small fraction of the whole Col-
loquiea
