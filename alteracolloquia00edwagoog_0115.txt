or later. Breakfast (at about 8) was introduced in schools and
universities in the fifteenth century3 but it was long regarded
as an ‘ extra,' to be dispensed with by the more hardy and
economical studente. It was a very informal meal, consisting
of a mug of beer and a crust of bread. Gaspar's family have
dinner (prandium) at 10. Supper (cena) would be at 6 or
thereabouts.

19. praestas ista quae doces, ‘do you practise what you
preach ⁸? ’

unfair advantage of his young friend; for pro virili parte is a
stereotyped phrase, which must not be pressed; it merely

si quid cessatum fuerit, ‘ it· there has been any slackness ’3

6. voluerit. The subjunctive is due to virtual oratio

(below). It is curicus to find the same word ludus meaning
both ‘play’ and ‘ school.’ It gets the latter signification
through that of ⁴ a place for practice or exercise '3 cf. qladiatores
in ludo habebat ‘he had gladiatore in a training-school’
(Caesar).

16. vapulem. How does vapulo obtain its passive meaning?
